## Forward Kinematics

Forward kinematics is the process of calculating the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector given the joint angles. This is a fundamental concept in robotics.

### Mathematical Foundation

The forward kinematics equation can be expressed as:

```
T = T₁ × T₂ × ... × Tₙ
```

Where each `Tᵢ` represents a transformation matrix for joint `i`.

## Inverse Kinematics

Inverse kinematics solves the opposite problem: given a desired end-effector position, what joint angles are needed?

This is typically more complex than forward kinematics as there may be multiple solutions or no solution at all.
