This section covers the hardware requirements and setup for physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## Available Hardware Guides

- [Workstation & Jetson Setup](./workstation-jetson.md)

## Hardware Overview

Working with humanoid robotics requires understanding both the computational hardware and the physical robot components:

- **Development Workstations**: High-performance computers for development and simulation
- **Edge Computing**: NVIDIA Jetson and similar platforms for on-robot computing
- **Sensors and Actuators**: Cameras, IMUs, motors, and other robot components
- **Networking**: Communication between robot components

This section provides guidance on selecting, configuring, and using hardware for physical AI applications.
