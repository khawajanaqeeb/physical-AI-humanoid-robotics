# Robotics Expert Skill

## Purpose
Apply expert-level knowledge in robotics, embodied AI, and humanoid systems to create comprehensive technical content for the textbook.

## Expertise Areas
- **Embodied Intelligence**: Sensorimotor learning, adaptive behavior, physical reasoning
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Kinematics, inverse kinematics (IK), whole-body control (WBC)
- **Locomotion**: Bipedal walking, gait generation, balance control, ZMP/CoM management
- **Actuation Systems**: Motors, servo control, actuator selection and design
- **Mechatronics**: Sensor integration, embedded systems, PCB design, motor drivers
- **Control Theory**: PID, MPC, compliance control, impedance control, force control
- **Physical Modeling**: Dynamics simulation, URDF/SDF modeling, physics engines

## When to Use This Skill
- Explaining humanoid robot mechanics and design principles
