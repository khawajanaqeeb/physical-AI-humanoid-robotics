# Technical Writer Skill

## Purpose
Write, edit, and polish technical content for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook with clarity, consistency, and academic rigor.

## Writing Capabilities
- **Technical Explanation**: Complex concepts in accessible language
- **Academic Style**: Formal, precise, authoritative tone
- **Clarity & Flow**: Logical progression, smooth transitions
- **Consistency**: Uniform terminology, notation, and style
- **Grammar & Editing**: Professional proofreading and refinement
- **Documentation**: API docs, code comments, setup guides
- **Summarization**: Condensing information while preserving key points
- **Expansion**: Elaborating on concepts with detail and examples

## When to Use This Skill
- Writing new textbook chapters or sections
- Editing existing content for clarity and flow
- Ensuring consistent terminology across chapters
- Polishing draft content for publication
- Creating glossary entries
- Writing learning summaries and abstracts
- Developing supplementary materials

## Writing Guidelines

### Style & Tone
- **Academic but Accessible**: Rigorous yet readable
- **Active Voice**: Prefer "The robot executes commands" over "Commands are executed by the robot"
- **Present Tense**: For describing systems and algorithms
- **Precise Terminology**: Use correct robotics/AI terms consistently
- **Avoid Jargon Overload**: Explain technical terms on first use

### Structure Principles
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Logical heading structure (H1, H2, H3)
- **Topic Sentences**: Each paragraph starts with main idea
- **Smooth Transitions**: Connect ideas between paragraphs and sections
- **Parallel Structure**: Consistent formatting for lists and comparisons
- **Signposting**: Guide readers through complex content

### Technical Content Best Practices
- **Define Before Use**: Introduce acronyms and terms clearly
- **Equation Integration**: Embed math naturally with explanation
- **Code Clarity**: Comment code, explain logic, show output
- **Cross-References**: Link related concepts across chapters
- **Examples**: Provide concrete instances of abstract concepts
- **Figures**: Reference and explain all diagrams and images

### Common Patterns

#### Introducing Concepts
```
[Concept Name] is a [general category] used for [purpose].
In humanoid robotics, [specific application]. For example,
[concrete example]. This approach offers [benefits] but
requires [considerations].
```

#### Explaining Algorithms
```
The [algorithm name] works by [high-level description].
The process consists of the following steps:

1. [Step 1]: [Explanation]
2. [Step 2]: [Explanation]
3. [Step 3]: [Explanation]

Mathematically, this can be expressed as: [equation]
where [variable definitions].
```

#### Comparing Approaches
```
While [Approach A] provides [advantage], it suffers from
[limitation]. In contrast, [Approach B] addresses this by
[solution], though it introduces [trade-off]. The choice
between these depends on [factors].
```

## Editing Checklist
- [ ] Clear learning objectives stated upfront
